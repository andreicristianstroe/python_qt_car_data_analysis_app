# python_qt_car_data_analysis_app

## Description
python_qt_car_data_analysis_app is a simple application for analyzing various car datas. I've built this app for a school project, and now I'm using it as a playground for testing and implementing new features.

## Features
1. Display Data Tab
2. Data Analysis Tab
3. Car Model Hierarchy Tab
4. Price Evolution Tab
5. Price Estimation Tab

## Usage
For the moment, run the main.py file from an IDE.
You can either clone the repository by running "git clone https://github.com/andreicristianstroe/python_qt_car_data_analysis_app.git".
Or you can simply go to Code -> Download ZIP and run it from there.

## Technical details
The app is built using Python and QtSide6, alongside Pandas and PandasGUI, Matplotlib and scikit-learn.

## TODO
Fix lots of stupid oversights and hard-coded values
Improve UI
Add new and useful analysis tools
